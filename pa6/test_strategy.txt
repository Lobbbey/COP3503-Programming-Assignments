For the testing strategy I began with setting up readin the input and displaying
the solution. From there I created the loop to begin and find the max of the 
problems solved. I changed the logic around when doing the max comparisions,
always checking compRows[0][i - 1] to check what came before. I continued to 
change the second comparison to ensrure I was comparing the correct variables
to get the desired amount. With the first test case I wanted to keep the numbers
simple but have a large number at the end to see how it would skew the results,
the correct output for this case is 61. For the second test case I wanted to check
how the program would handle a case with a minimal amount of numbers, the correct output is 12.
