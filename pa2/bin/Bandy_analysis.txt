The time complexity of the backtracking code used O(N^2XL) where N is the length
of the matrix holding the letters and L is the length of the word that needs to be
fond. Since a starting point is unknown the letter matrix needs to be
traversed in order to find a spot to start testing if the word is in the
letter matrix. After a starting point is found, the wordToFind array needs to be
traversed alongside the letter matrix in order to find the word. With both
of these conditions the code runs at time complexity O(N^2XL).
